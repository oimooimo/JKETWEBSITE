            Japan Heritage Centre
            </h2>

            <p>
                The Japanese Heritage Centre, opened in 2016, is a place for children and families residing in Auckland, New Zealand to learn and explore their Japanese linguistic and cultural heritage. We provide small classes with fun filled opportunities that motivate the students to use the Japanese language. Our main goal is to foster their desire to continue learning the Japanese language and culture. We recognize that our multicultural children are in the unique, fortunate, and sometimes difficult situation of living in two worlds, Japanese and NZ. Our children build their self-esteem, self-confidence, and the social skills needed to support their lives in both communities.
