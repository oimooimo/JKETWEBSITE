            <p class="paddingbottom"> The Japan Kauri Education Trust is to preserve Japanese cultural and linguistic
			heritage for the next generation of Japanese in New Zealand. For this purpose, 
			the Trust will conduct educational activities which will help the next generation
			be proud of and comfortable with their identity and achieve their full potential.
			Also, the Trust will promote effective relationships with local communities, and 
			bridge the gap between the New Zealand and Japanese cultures to foster mutual 
			recognition and understanding which leads to enriched multicultural society.
