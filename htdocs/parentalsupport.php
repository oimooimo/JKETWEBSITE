            <h2>Parental Support</h2>
            <p>Being a parent can be hard. When moving to New Zealand we know that many families and mothers struggle with raising children while coming to terms with cultural differences. We at JKET provide parental support to both recent and old expats from Japan, and aim to help provide services and aid. We understand that asking for help can be difficult, but aim to change this mindset and help the community.</p>
